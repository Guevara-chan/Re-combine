* Progress tracking between conversion sessions.
* Optimized non-script parsing engine.

# 「Reassembling」
__Re:combine__  was developed entirelly in [Boo v0.9.7.0](https://github.com/boo-lang/boo), with help of [System.Data.SQLite](https://system.data.sqlite.org) external library package.  
It requires .NET 4.0 framework to run, though confirmed as being mostly compatible with [Mono 4.6.2+](https://github.com/mono/mono).
